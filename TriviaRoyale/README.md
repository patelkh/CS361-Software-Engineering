Portfolio Project

Each person on your team must create their own individual project plus a microservice. Your individual project must request data, receive data, and use data from a teammate's service. It must also have a user interface (ex: GUI, command-line, voice control, etc.) You must provide a service to at least one teammate's individual project.

For implementation, you get to choose your programming language.
